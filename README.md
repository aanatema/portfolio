# PORTFOLIO

The main idea behind this project was to go more in depth with React.js. I first worked with React on a school project, an e-commerce plateform called Consonea (find it here : https://github.com/aanatema/projet-collectif-site-e-commerce-de-mobilier-Consonea). I enjoyed working on this project and will be updating it regularly.
